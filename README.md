# Panda-Workflow

## Description
This application is designed to let the user have a planner that will display the current date and has timeblocks for standerd buisness hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate wether it is in the past,present, or future. When you click on a timeblock you can enter an event and save it using the button on each timeblock. The appointment will be saved in local storage and will persist when the page is refreshed.
